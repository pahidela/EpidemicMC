# EpidemicMC
This a little project that I developed in my MSc for the Complex Networks subject.
You can find C++ code which computes Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a theoretical probabilist framework. 
In the projectReport.pdf you can find a detailed explanation of what the project consists of, as well as the results obtained.
